# Reproduction of SHOT in ICML 2020

## Author's Github
https://github.com/tim-learn/SHOT

## Some Tips
### Step 1
First, download the dataset,Office,Office-Home,VisDA-C,Office-Caltech with the link in author's github. And put the dataset into the folder e.g. './Office','./office-home'. I suggest you download the dataset with the tool **IDM**.
### Step 2
You need to generate some â€™.txt' file and put it into the right folder. The content in the file should be the path and type of each image. I've already done it for you, just use it. You'll find the file in the folder e.g. '/data/Office/','/data/office-home/'.  
### Step 3
Use the command in author's github then you can obtain the results. Some issues in author's github are also useful.
