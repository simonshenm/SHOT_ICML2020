# Reproduction-of-SHOT
Hi!This is Shen's work on reproduction of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08546) published in ICML 2020 namely SHOT. **This is just for research and study. If there is any infringement, please tell me.** The original work is [here](https://github.com/tim-learn/SHOT)! It's awsome! Some steps in my work are as follows.

## Step 1: Download the datasets 
[Office](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4IapRTv9pJ1WGZVd1VDMmhwdlE/view)
[Office-Home](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B81rNlvomiwed0V1YUxQdC1uOTg/view)
[VisDA-C](https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/taskcv-2017-public/tree/master/classification)
[Office-Caltech](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz)

**Attention:** I suggest you download these datasets with the tool **IDM**. If you have any trouble downloading these datasets, I can share with you only for research.

## Step 2: Generate the corresponding '.txt' file
You need to generate the corresponding '.txt' file like 'amazon_list.txt' and 'dslr_list.txt' in './object/data/Office/amazon_list.txt' and './object/data/Office/dslr_list.txt'. Don't worry! I've already done this work for you, just use it!

## Step 3: Use the command to run the program
